# ML-K-Nearest-Neighbors-and-Random-Forest
Two different machine learning classification models will be applied which are K Nearest Neighbors and Random Forests.
 Overview about the iris dataset that has been used in my programs
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.
Attribute Information:
1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class:
o Iris Setosa
o Iris Versicolour
